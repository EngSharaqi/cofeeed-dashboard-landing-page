## Task requirements: 

Bear in mind that the task should include:

* Routing/navigation using the sidebar - visual appearance for the active link

* Reusability of the application's components - as in feeds section

* API consumption and services - no issues if you create your own promise and your own data, or you can use any api as in :RapidAPI .

* Design flexibility and responsiveness is important, and should be consistent.

* Clicking on a story - search - notification - upload - profile picture, comments' icon should NOT trigger any actions.
